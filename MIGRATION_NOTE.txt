⚠️ Note: Database migration command prepared but requires database connection to execute.
Schema changes for payment tracking fields (amountPaidByAgency, amountReceived) are already in prisma/schema.prisma.
User should run: npx prisma migrate dev --name add_payment_tracking_fields when database is available.
